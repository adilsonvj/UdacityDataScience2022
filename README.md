## 2. Project Motivation

This project is part of the Udacity data science nano degree, the goal of this project is to apply the data science
techniques over a dataset, answering some of the business questions using the CRISP framework.
This project was created over the Seattle Airbnb listings from April 2016. Analyzing which features are more correlated
with the host experience.

In the end, some of the business questions that we want to answer in the end is:

Does the features related to the host has importance in the experience and the review score? (e.g. being super host, verifications, etc..).

Which region has the highest and lowest average daily price, number of places available, and review score?

Which home feature has the highest importance to influence a good experience? (e.g. amenities, property type, room type, bed type, etc..).

Based on it, hosts would improve their places by knowing exactly what to focus aiming for better reviews. At the same time, guests would use the informations provided here to filter for the best place and have a better experience.
